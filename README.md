Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

1. What was your experience?

- I wanted to build a project using Tailwind CSS in order to improve my skills with Tailwind and this project was a good opportunity to use Tailwind.
- I used grid in order to align the images according to the design provided and create a responsive design as well .

2. What have you learned/improved?

- In this project I was able to learn how to use different Tailwind classes and extend the functionalities of Tailwind according to the project's requirement.

3. Your wisdom? :)

- Using Tailwind CSS over normal CSS was a pretty good experience. Tailwind covers a wide variety of classes, which makes it pretty simple to use. The setup for tailwind was a little bit tedious for me, but after setting it up, everything was smooth sailing.
